# WordEmbeddings-GloVe
**Word Embeddings with GloVe**   This project uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings to analyze word relationships. It computes cosine similarity between words (e.g., "cat" and "dog" with 0.9218 similarity) and finds top-5 similar words (e.g., "king" returns "prince," "queen," etc.), demonstrating skills in NLP and vector semantics.
